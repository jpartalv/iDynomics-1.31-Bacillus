/**
 * \brief Defines the bulk boundary: the concentration on the boundary is
 * fixed by a dynamic bulk, the agents crossing this line die.
 * 
 * This boundary simulates the connection to a larger bulk liquid subject to a
 * dilution process, as would be typical for a reactor. Behaviour for agents
 * does not differ from the constant concentration boundary case (and so
 * within the computational domain the boundary condition is identical), but
 * solute dynamics in the bulk compartment require an additional computational
 * step. In this step, ordinary differential equations describing the
 * reactions occurring in the biofilm and the hydraulic processes affecting 
 * the bulk liquid are solved in order to determine the bulk concentration at
 * the next time-step.
