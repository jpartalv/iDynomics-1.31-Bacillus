 * 
 * The mark-up defines the erosion forces that act on the biofilm surface.
 * Detachment works by removing a layer of biomass based on the detachment
 * speed and the timestep, with the detachment speed calculated via one of the
 * given forms. This class captures the Quadratic detachment method.
